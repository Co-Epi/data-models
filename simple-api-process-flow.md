##Exposure and Symptoms Record (POST)
Request:
- Symptoms record (Answers from symptoms interview)
- Datestamp
 - Geohash(es) covering the geo-location of some/all exposure records
 - Exposure Record (List of all BLE Proximity Event UUIDs within that geohash)
Response: just a confirmation code or error message

Server assembles all exposure records for each datestamp and (optionally, as we scale) shards them by geohash
- each BLE Proximity Event UUIDs is truncated to include only the first 64 bits of the version-4 UUIDs

##Exposure Check (GET)
- All Exposure Records (with shortened UUIDs) for a given date (and optionally geohash)
 - Date (and optionally geohash) are components of the API GET URI
- As we scale, the response should have cache-control headers with an appropriate TTL (maybe 1h) and be cached so it doesnâ€™t need to be pulled from the DB every time.

Client checks its own local record of all BLE Proximity Event UUIDs against those in the Exposure Check response
If a match is found, the client alerts the user, displays date/time and location of the match, and requests permission to share exposure(s) and request case record(s)

##Confirmed Exposure (POST)
Request:
- Full BLE Proximity Event UUID(s) (all 128 bits)
Response:
- Symptoms Record, including reported symptoms + severity, dates, etc.
